This code was written to analyze student submitted projects of apps that they made using MIT's app inventor software. 
I developed a rubric to quantify the complexity of each component and code block that was used in the projects.
This rubric was then used to score each project for how "complex" or "advanced" their code is.
The analysis was done using classic data analysis tools: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and MatplotLib.
